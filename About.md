# About #
This project is the verilog code for a processor that can execute basic commands. Was created as an assignment for the Digital System Design course.
It consists of three files.
- A deoder file, that can decode the register numbers to commands in the control unit that can help in enabling them
- A control unit, which is actually a Finite State Machine, that can translate the instruction code into the control signals for registers and the ALU.
- A main circuit file, that has the code for the ALU, and also the registers.
